         Reporting Problems and Receiving Support
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  At first make sure that the problem you have encountered while packing
or executing compressed application is not an ordinary situation or a known
problem: see MPRESS ReadMe, TechInfo. Only if the problem is not known, send
an email to ve@matcode.com, otherwise there's no need to produce extra
traffic, it does not stimulate developers in any way.
In your email specify the conditions to reproduce the problem:
what file caused the problem (where to get it). You should attach
the file to your message, only if the file size does not exceed 400k.
A general notice concerning files attached - it is specific to the
mailserver that any files attached with .exe, .dll, .sys, .ocx, .cpl,
.scr, ... etc. executable extensions are removed. So, before sending
such files to matcode.com, you should archive them first.
